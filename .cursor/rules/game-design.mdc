# Murder Mystery AI Game Design Principles

## Core Experience
- Focus on natural voice interactions with suspects
- Prioritize immersion and character believability
- Make evidence collection intuitive and rewarding
- Create a satisfying "aha!" moment when solving the case

## AI Character Design
- Suspects should have consistent personalities
- Responses should reflect the character's background and motives
- Under pressure, suspects may reveal hints about their secrets
- Guilty suspects should behave differently than innocent ones
- Each suspect should have unique speech patterns and knowledge

## Evidence System
- Evidence should be discoverable through clever questioning
- Contradictions should be highlighted and trackable
- Players should be able to reference evidence during interrogations
- Evidence collection should feel like detective work, not a checklist

## Accusation System
- Accusation should be a significant decision
- Feedback should reflect the strength of the player's case
- Correct accusations with weak evidence should feel less satisfying
- Incorrect accusations should provide guidance for further investigation

## Atmosphere
- UI should reinforce the detective mystery theme
- Visual elements should support the narrative
- Audio elements should enhance immersion
- Transitions and animations should be subtle and appropriate

## Accessibility
- Provide text alternatives to voice interaction
- Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
- Design with colorblind accessibility in mind
- Include clear instructions and guidance for players
