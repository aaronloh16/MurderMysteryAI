## Up Next 📋

### Phase 2: Evidence System

- 📋 Define evidence data structure
- 📋 Create evidence UI components
- 📋 Implement evidence collection during interrogations

### Phase 3: Game Flow & Polish

- 📋 Implement game state management
- 📋 Add interrogation history
- 📋 Create win/lose conditions
- 📋 Develop game summary screen

## Future Work 🔮

### Phase 4: Final Integration & Testing

- 🔮 Conduct integration testing
- 🔮 Perform performance optimization
- 🔮 Add final polish and refinements

## Known Issues 🐛

1. **Agent Context**: Suspect-specific context not consistently applied
2. **Image Loading**: Need to handle image loading states better

## Next Immediate Steps 👣

1. Debug suspect context handling in the agent
2. Implement accusation button on the interrogation page
3. Begin developing evidence tracking system
4. Add guilty suspect identification in the database
