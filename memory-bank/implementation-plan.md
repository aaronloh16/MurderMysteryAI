# Murder Mystery AI Implementation Plan

This implementation plan outlines the step-by-step process to complete a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Murder Mystery AI game. Each step includes a specific task, implementation details, and a test to validate completion.

## Phase 1: Fix Remaining Issues & Add Accusation System

### Step 1: Implement Consistent Suspect Context

**Task:** Ensure agent correctly receives and uses the suspect context.
**Implementation:**

1. Update room metadata to include suspect ID
2. Debug metadata parsing in the agent
3. Implement proper error handling for missing metadata

**Test:** Agent responds as the correct suspect (Alex or Sarah) based on the room selection.

### Step 2: Create Accusation Button Component

**Task:** Add an accusation button to the interrogation page.
**Implementation:**

1. Create AccusationButton component
2. Style the button to match the game's design
3. Add basic state management for accusation flow

**Test:** Button appears on the interrogation page and shows a confirmation dialog when clicked.

### Step 3: Implement Accusation Logic

**Task:** Add the functionality to process accusations and provide feedback.
**Implementation:**

1. Create accusation handler function
2. Add state for tracking accusation results
3. Implement feedback UI for correct/incorrect accusations
4. Update suspects data to indicate which suspect is guilty

**Test:** Accusing the guilty suspect results in "Correct" feedback, while accusing others results in "Incorrect" feedback.

## Phase 2: Evidence System

### Step 4: Define Evidence Data Structure

**Task:** Create the data model for evidence items.
**Implementation:**

1. Create evidence interfaces in the data folder
2. Define sample evidence items for testing
3. Implement utility functions for evidence operations

**Test:** Evidence data can be properly loaded and manipulated through utility functions.

### Step 5: Create Evidence UI Components

**Task:** Build the UI for displaying evidence items.
**Implementation:**

1. Create EvidenceItem component
2. Implement EvidenceList component for the story page
3. Style evidence components to match the game design

**Test:** Evidence items render correctly on the story page with proper styling.

### Step 6: Connect Evidence to Interrogations

**Task:** Implement evidence collection during interrogations.
**Implementation:**

1. Create a system to track key statements
2. Add context awareness for contradictions
3. Implement evidence collection logic

**Test:** New evidence items appear after revelations during interrogations.

## Phase 3: Game Flow & Polish

### Step 7: Implement Game State Management

**Task:** Create a centralized game state to track progress.
**Implementation:**

1. Create a GameContext using React Context API
2. Implement reducer functions for game state updates
3. Connect relevant components to the context

**Test:** Game state persists between page navigations and properly tracks evidence and accusations.

### Step 8: Add Interrogation History

**Task:** Implement a conversation history feature.
**Implementation:**

1. Create a ConversationHistory component
2. Track and display recent exchanges
3. Style the history to match the game design

**Test:** Conversation history appears during interrogations and updates with new exchanges.

### Step 9: Implement Win/Lose Conditions

**Task:** Add game completion logic and feedback.
**Implementation:**

1. Create win/lose detection based on evidence and accusations
2. Implement a summary screen for game results
3. Add replay functionality

**Test:** Game correctly identifies a winning scenario when Alex is accused with sufficient evidence.

## Phase 4: Final Integration & Testing

### Step 10: Integration Testing

**Task:** Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
**Implementation:**

1. Test the complete game flow from start to finish
2. Verify all transitions between states
3. Fix any interaction issues

**Test:** Complete several successful game playthroughs with different approaches.

### Step 11: Performance Optimization

**Task:** Improve loading times and responsiveness.
**Implementation:**

1. Implement code splitting for larger components
2. Optimize image loading
3. Add loading states for async operations

**Test:** Game loads and responds quickly with no noticeable lag.

### Step 12: Final Polishing

**Task:** Add final touches to improve user experience.
**Implementation:**

1. Add subtle animations for transitions
2. Improve error messages and feedback
3. Add hints for first-time players

**Test:** User experience feels smooth and intuitive.
